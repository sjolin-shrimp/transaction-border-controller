# DEPRECATED – VGP-00: Value Gateway Protocol

**Status:** Deprecated  
**Superseded by:** TGP-00 and PEL-0.1  

VGP-00 originally described carrier-grade deployment behavior for TGP
(telemetry, policy enforcement, and gateway federation).  
These concepts have been merged into:

- **TGP-00 Section 12:** Settlement Paths & Gateway Telemetry  
- **Policy Expression Language (PEL-0.1):** Higher-layer policy semantics
